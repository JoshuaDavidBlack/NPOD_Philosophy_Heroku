This dashboard allows for the inspection of a random subset of the main corpora developed in course of the project and for the generation and inspection of co-occurrence networks of key terms in the corpora.

The full general philosophy corpus and religion-science corpus are availble for download as zip files containing the articles in markdown format: (add links)

The corpora, and labelled dataset used for training classifiers, are also available as pickled pandas dataframes along with almost all other project files and got at the project's [GitHub page](https://github.com/JoshuaDavidBlack/NPOD_Philosophy).

Code for this dashboard is available at <https://github.com/JoshuaDavidBlack/NPOD_Philosophy>.

**Note:** this page contains terms, and charts relationships between terms, from the text of nineteenth century newspapers using various statistical learning methods. As such, it is likely to contain offensive material.
